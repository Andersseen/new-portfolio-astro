**Last updated:** 2026-07-07 · **Branch state:** `main` with uncommitted Lighthouse/SEO/a11y improvements

## Status: ✅ Stable, build passes

`pnpm check` and `pnpm build` pass. Local Lighthouse scores (Python `http.server`) are
**Performance ~93, Accessibility 100, Best Practices 96, SEO 92**. Best Practices 96 is
only because `/api/theme` 404s locally (no serverless runtime); SEO 92 is due to an
Astro dev-toolbar "Learn more" link that only appears in local runs — both should be
100 on Vercel.

## Recently completed (last few cycles)

- **Lighthouse / SEO / accessibility push**
  - Added `site`, `trailingSlash: "always"`, `@astrojs/sitemap`, `og-image.png`,
    canonical/Open Graph/Twitter/hreflang metadata in `BaseHead.astro`.
  - Fixed `hreflang` for Ukrainian: code is now `uk` while URL path stays `/ua/`.
  - Fixed residual color contrast: badges use `text-foreground`, article card link
    no longer uses `text-primary` on `bg-background-secondary`.
  - Fixed card accessible names: removed `aria-label` from `PortfolioCard` buttons
    so visible text becomes the accessible name.
  - Improved Preact `AboutDrawer` with `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`,
    `aria-labelledby`, initial focus and focus trap.
  - Replaced fake `div role="button"` navbar logo with a real `<button>`.
  - Added CSP/security headers in `vercel.json`, replaced `atob` with
    `Buffer.from`, added `noopener` to external links, fixed `fetchpriority` case.
- **Theme system overhaul** (PRs #14, #15 — `feature/theme`): Palette Crafter
  API integration via `/api/theme` proxy, primary/secondary color *scales*
  (50–950), dark-mode-aware palettes, IndexedDB persistence, refined UI colors
  and interactive states.
- **Blog link** added to portfolio data / social card.
- **Angular migration of selected components** (PR #13): navbar, about-drawer
  (signals + computed), github-activity, footer — replacing the Preact header.
- **Shared-element modal** (`feature/morph`, PR #12): FLIP-style card→modal
  transition with phase state machine in `modalStore.ts`.

## In progress / next up

- (empty — pick from Backlog or the user's request)

## Backlog / known intentions

- Fill in `image: ""` fields for projects in `src/data/portfolio.ts`
  (project cards have no images yet).
- Contact form UI for `/api/send-email` (endpoint exists and is validated;
  no form component is wired to it yet — verify before building).
- Type-narrow `PortfolioItem.details` (currently `any` per card type).
- Language selector keyboard UX (arrow navigation, focus return) is still basic.

## Known issues / tech debt

- `PortfolioItem.details: any` — each card type casts its own shape.
- Old feature branches `feature/morph`, `feature/theme` still exist locally
  (already merged); safe to delete.
- No automated tests; regressions are caught only by `pnpm check` + manual review.
- `src/components/ui/README.md` may drift from the actual component props —
  trust the code, then fix the README.
- Large JS bundles for Angular/Lit web components (`and-*`, `client.*`) inflate
  the client payload. Consider lazy-loading non-critical islands or auditing
  component imports if Performance needs to improve beyond ~93 locally.

## Environment notes

- `.env` exists locally with `THEME_API_BASE_URL` (Palette Crafter) — required
  for the theme randomizer. `RESEND_API_KEY` optional (email returns 500 without it).
- Deploys happen from `main` via Vercel Git integration; env vars are set in
  the Vercel dashboard.

## Session log (append newest first, keep ~10 entries, one line each)

- 2026-07-07 — Lighthouse/SEO/accessibility improvements: sitemap, meta tags, hreflang, contrast, card a11y, Preact drawer focus, security headers. Build passes.
- 2026-07-06 — Created agent documentation set (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/*). No app code changed.
